# SP MDL Child Theme

Child Theme for the [SP MDL](https://github.com/sunny-pixels/sp-mdl) WordPress theme.


### Usage
Simply download the zip and upload the zip ([sp-mdl-child-theme.zip](https://github.com/sunny-pixels/sp-mdl-child-theme/releases/download/v1.0.0/sp-mdl-child-theme.zip)) under your WordPress dashboard at Appearance > Themes. Or extract and upload via FTP at wp-content/themes/.


### Renaming
You can of course rename the zip file so it isn't called [sp-mdl-child-theme.zip](https://github.com/sunny-pixels/sp-mdl-child-theme/releases/download/v1.0.0/sp-mdl-child-theme.zip) (you should do this so it makes more sense) and also change the "Theme Name" at the top of the style.css file.

### Note
When using a child theme (see [http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development]()
and [http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes]()), you can override certain
functions (those wrapped in a function_exists() call) by defining them first
in your child theme's [functions.php](./functions.php) file. The child theme's 
[functions.php](./functions.php) file is included before the parent theme's file,
so the child theme functions would be used.
